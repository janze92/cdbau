CustomDataBaseAutoUpdater

This will eventually fetch custom.db from your custom Archlinux repository
and compare package version from AUR to your versions. If aur version is newer
will try download and build from aur. After that all packages are complete
should update custom.db file for repository.

Not yet doing that tho.. :D
